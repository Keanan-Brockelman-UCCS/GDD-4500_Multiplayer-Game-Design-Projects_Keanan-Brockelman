README File
Name
- Tank the Crown
Description
- A simple tank game where you fight 2-4 players for the crown. Hold it for 15 seconds * player count to win the game. Good luck and have fun!
Player Count
- 1-4 Player
Controls
- WASD & D-Pad for Movement, Space and A to Shoot
Known Issues
- The multiplayer on a single keyboard thing doesn't work the way I am using inputs.
- It can technically support more than 4 players, but it would break the UI and coloring for the tanks.
- As a single player, you are more memorizing maps than actually playing, its very boring.
- The tanks can get flipped over and have no way but another player to flip back up. Doesn't mean you game is over though... just mostly...
Shoutouts
- Thank you chatGPT for being my rubber ducky/researcher who can give me streamlined answers that I can dig farther into. Minimal to no code was copied and if it was, it was to debug a line of code that I forgot to remove or some comments when I failed to find the words.
- Kenney's assets are the best, could not have made the tutorial things without them.
